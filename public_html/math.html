                    <p>
                        The entire father's side of my family was very math-oriented, so I got into mathematics from a very young age. I started learning with my father, and eventually took extra courses and attended summer math camps. The NYC Museum of Math is one of my favorite museums, and wherever we travel my parents always try to find something math-related—whether it’s the Boston Museum of Science or the National Cryptologic Museum between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. And if they don’t find anything, I keep asking until they do.

                            My very first camp was Delta. We explored number systems, mathematical logic, prime numbers, fractals, symmetry, and more. We lived on a university campus for two weeks and spent about 4–5 hours a day doing math. As boring as that might sound, it was amazing. And being able to pick my own food in the dining hall definitely added to the fun.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            After Delta, I “graduated” to Epsilon where I spent three wonderful summers with friends studying subjects like number theory, Euclidean geometry, combinatorics, set theory, and group theory. It wasn’t just advanced material compared to school—it was different math, and it opened my eyes to how creative the subject can be.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            More recently, I moved on to Campersand and I’ve been going every summer since, progressing from camper to scholar and, hopefully next year, to counselor. Campersand is where the real magic happens. Each summer brings entirely new themes, from the fun corners of calculus to statistical simulation and compartment models, to cryptography, to computational linguistics. It has been one of the most defining and inspiring parts of my math journey.
